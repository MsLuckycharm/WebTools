      <h2>My Background</h2>
        <p>Hello there, traveler! I'm <strong>Ms_Luckycharm</strong>, born and raised in the heart of Dallas, Texas. My roots are in business—I hold a bachelor’s degree in it—but curiosity has always pulled me toward the world of technology. These days, I'm pursuing a second bachelor’s in Applied Technology, bridging the gap between structured strategy and hands-on problem-solving.</p>
        <p>Currently, I’m enrolled in SQL courses, strengthening my ability to communicate with databases and understanding how information flows behind the scenes. My background may seem like a winding road, but each step has added layers to who I am today—a creative thinker with a knack for connecting dots. I believe that blending business and tech gives me a superpower: the ability to build solutions that are not just smart, but impactful.</p>
