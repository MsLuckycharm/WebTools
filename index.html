      <h2>My Background</h2>
      <p>Hello! I'm a single mompreneur of two amazing children and a dedicated professional in the hair industry. For nearly a decade, I’ve worked in this creative field, helping others feel confident and beautiful. I truly love what I do, and the artistry of hair has always been a natural fit for my hands and my heart.</p>

      <p>Even with my hands in hair, my mind has always been curious about the world of technology. Ever since I was a kid, I’ve had a knack for tinkering—whether it was taking apart gaming devices or reassembling old computers. Luckily, I never broke anything permanently! That early curiosity never left me. Outside of work and learning, I enjoy traveling as much as possible. My dream is to live abroad one day and work remotely, combining my love for adventure with a flexible tech career.</p>
