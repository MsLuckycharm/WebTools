      <h2>My Background</h2>
      <p>Hello there, traveler! I'm <strong>Ms_Luckycharm</strong>, born and raised in the heart of Dallas, Texas. My roots are in business—I hold a bachelor’s degree in it—but curiosity has always pulled me toward the world of technology. These days, I'm pursuing a second bachelor’s in Applied Technology, bridging the gap between structured strategy and hands-on problem-solving. </p>
      <p>Currently, I’m enrolled in SQL courses, strengthening my ability to communicate with databases and understanding how information flows behind the scenes. My background may seem like a winding road, but each step has added layers to who I am today—a creative thinker with a knack for connecting dots. I believe that blending business and tech gives me a superpower: the ability to build solutions that are not just smart, but impactful. </p>

      <h2>My Avatar</h2>
      <p>So, who is <em>Ms_Luckycharm</em>? Think of her as a spirited wanderer with a laptop in her backpack and a dream in her heart. She’s goofy, charismatic, and fiercely determined. She was created to mirror the version of myself I aspire to become—a global tech nomad who codes at sunrise and explores new cities by sunset.</p>
      <p>She exists to embody my drive for freedom, growth, and creativity. Her story speaks for anyone who's ever had to start over, pivot, or keep pushing through setbacks. Every line of code she writes is a step closer to independence. Through her, I’m turning personal goals into tangible outcomes—proof that resilience can be translated into digital success.</p>

      <section id="journey">
        <h2> My Web Development Journey</h2>
        <p>With a foundation in coding already under my belt, stepping into web development felt like a natural next chapter. After all, most modern tools and platforms are built on the backbone of code—just spoken in different dialects. Learning how to structure, style, and breathe life into a web page gives me a sense of control and creativity I’ve never felt before.</p>
        <p>That’s why I’m so excited about <cite>Launch Studio</cite>. This journey isn’t just about writing HTML or CSS—it’s about building something that reflects who I am and where I’m going. Launch Studio makes coding feel accessible and empowering. I’m eager to turn ideas into interactive pages and collaborate with others who share the same fire. The road ahead is long, but hey, Ms_Luckycharm was born ready.</p>
