      <h2>My Background</h2>
      <p>Hello! I'm a single mompreneur of two amazing children and a dedicated professional in the hair industry. For nearly a decade, I’ve worked in this creative field, helping others feel confident and beautiful. I truly love what I do, and the artistry of hair has always been a natural fit for my hands and my heart.</p>

      <p>Even with my hands in hair, my mind has always been curious about the world of technology. Ever since I was a kid, I’ve had a knack for tinkering—whether it was taking apart gaming devices or reassembling old computers. Luckily, I never broke anything permanently! That early curiosity never left me. Outside of work and learning, I enjoy traveling as much as possible. My dream is to live abroad one day and work remotely, combining my love for adventure with a flexible tech career.</p>

      <h2>My Avatar</h2>
      <p>For this class, I’ve envisioned a unique character that represents both who I am now and who I’m becoming. My avatar is a fearless computer progammer who love to help other learn coding in terms that children that can understand. Coding can be challenging but with the ritght tools and techniques, it can be broken down to be made simplier. </p>

        <h2> My Web Development Journey</h2>
          <p> I'm currently learning SQL for a programming langugage as I took the first half of C++ last semester and I really enjoyed the class. I'm taking this class so I will become better at building website vs using other websites like weebly to build my website for me. I want to learn a few more programming languages with the hopes of creating my own video game around my avatar.</p>>
